===============================================================

Introduction:
============
This folder contains the code files that were used to create the three figures of the paper.

System Requirements:
====================
This code has been written for and tested using:
	- MATLAB R2019b (9.7)
	- Gurobi 8.1.1

Instructions:
=============
In order the recreate the figures, simply run the correspondingly named MATLAB script. The  scripts will call all the necessary functions. Ensure that the function 'gurobi(...)' can be called. This may require adding the gurobi path to the working directory.

Run Time:
=========
Please note that Figures 2 & 3 require quite the number of simulations and depending on your system, they can take hours or days to execute. In order to obtain a better idea of the run time on your system, reduce the number of trails by setting the 'trials' variable to around 100 for Figure_2_Left, 5 for Figure_2_Right and 10 for Figure_3, and record the execution time for the entire script. The execution time roughly scales linearly as you increase the number of trails used. Reducing the number of trails is also recommended for testing of the script prior to running a full simulation.

Seed:
=====
The file 'seed.mat' contains the seed for the random number generation and ensures that the exact same random graphs are generated for each execution of the scripts.

Saving of data:
===============
The files 'Data_Fig_2_Left.mat', 'Data_Fig_2_Right.mat' and 'Data_Fig_3.mat' contain the data set that is created by running the scripts for Figures 2 & 3. This data is generated by executing the correspondingly named script which will overwrite these files with the newly created simulations.

Reference data:
===============
The files 'Data_Fig_2_Left_Ref.mat', 'Data_Fig_2_Right_Ref.mat' and 'Data_Fig_3_Ref.mat' contain the data set used to generate the Figures 2 & 3 of the paper. This data can be generated by executing the correspondingly named script. The files are included to save the user having to run the actual simulations as well as for easy comparison to another data set. To avoid overwriting preexisting variables in the workspace, all of the reference variables have the suffix _ref added to them. This means that when attempting to plot the figures directly from the reference data, the plot commands needs to be altered to match the reference variable names.
